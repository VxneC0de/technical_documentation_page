# Technical Documentation Page

> This page is based on a Free Code Camp project about responsive web design, specifically the ‚ÄúBuild a Technical Documentation Page‚Äù project. I decided to create my technical documentation page using CSS, including an explanation of Flexbox. Additionally, since it‚Äôs a Free Code Camp project, I used the required methods, tags, properties, and other elements to complete the page, and even incorporated a media query
